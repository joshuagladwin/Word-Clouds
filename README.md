# Word Clouds

I've created a word cloud of the nouns in the [Grundrechte](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_rights_in_the_German_Constitution) (Fundamental rights in the German Constitution, Art. 1-19 of the Grundgesetz - the German Basic Law), using an outline of a [map of Germany](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Germany-Outline.svg) as the mask.

This has been created with help from the guides and examples given [here](http://amueller.github.io/word_cloud/auto_examples/index.html).

This is based on an earlier work,  creating a word cloud of the [Grundgesetz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_Law_for_the_Federal_Republic_of_Germany) (German Basic Law), in the shape of the [Bundesadler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coat_of_arms_of_Germany#Federal_Republic_of_Germany_).

## Things to Do/Improve

- [x] ~~Create Basic Word Cloud~~
- [x] ~~Identify more stopwords to remove, such as frequently occuring functional terms, z.B. _Absatz_.~~
- [x] ~~Change default colour scheme (Overlay flag colours?)~~
- [x] ~~Reduce words to stems to remove similar entries, z.B. _bestimmt_-_bestimmen_, _Gesetz_-_Gesetze__.~~
- [ ] ~~Alter the area where the words are placed. Currently words appear just in the black parts of the image.~~
- [ ] ~~Try a more complicated image mask, such the full coat of arms~~

## Future Goals
- [ ] Attempt this project with a different language and text, z.B. Japanese and Constitution of Japan?
- [ ] UN Declaration of Human Rights in colours and form of country flags?
